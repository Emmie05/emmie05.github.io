# Emmanuel's Portfolio Project

Welcome to my portfolio project! This web application showcases a toolkit with two essential tools: a GPA Calculator and a Resistor Color Code Generator. It's designed to be user-friendly and visually appealing.

## Features

- **GPA Calculator**: Calculate your GPA by entering your courses, grades, and credit hours. The tool supports a wide range of grades and provides instant results.
- **Resistor Color Code Generator**: Select resistor band colors to get the calculated resistance value. This tool simplifies the process of determining resistor values for circuit design.

## Live Demo

You can view the live deployed version of the application [here](https://emmie05.github.io/Portfolio-Project/).
